📊 Smart Expense Tracker Application

📌 Project Overview

The Smart Expense Tracker Application is a Python-based project designed to help users record, manage, analyze, and visualize daily expenses.
This application demonstrates the practical use of Python programming concepts such as control structures, object-oriented programming (OOP), NumPy, Pandas, and data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

The project allows users to log expenses, analyze spending patterns, and generate meaningful insights through graphical representations.

🎯 Objectives
	•	To build a real-world expense tracking system
	•	To apply Python fundamentals and advanced libraries
	•	To analyze financial data using NumPy and Pandas
	•	To visualize spending patterns using graphs and charts
	•	To write clean, modular, and reusable code

⸻

🛠️ Technologies Used
	•	Python – Core programming language
	•	NumPy – Numerical calculations (total, average, percentages)
	•	Pandas – Data loading, cleaning, grouping, and filtering
	•	Matplotlib – Basic data visualization
	•	Seaborn – Advanced and attractive visualizations
	•	CSV File Handling – Dataset storage

⸻

🧠 Concepts Implemented

1. Control Structures & Arrays
	•	Used if-else statements for input validation
	•	Used while loop for menu-driven program
	•	Used Python lists to store valid categories

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
	•	Implemented a single class ExpenseTracker
	•	Used:
	•	__init__() for initialization
	•	Methods for each core functionality
	•	Ensured encapsulation and modular design

3. NumPy Integration
	•	Converted expense amounts into NumPy arrays
	•	Calculated:
	•	Total expenses
	•	Average expenses
	•	Improved computational efficiency

4. Pandas for Data Handling
	•	Loaded data from expenses.csv
	•	Cleaned and managed datasets
	•	Grouped data by:
	•	Category
	•	Date
	•	Generated summary reports

5. Data Visualization

The following graphs are generated:
	•	Bar Chart – Total expense by category
	•	Line Graph – Expense trend over time
	•	Pie Chart – Expense distribution by category
	•	Histogram – Frequency of expense amounts

All charts include titles, labels, and legends for clarity.

📂 Dataset Details

The application uses a CSV file named expenses.csv with the following columns:

Column Name	Description
Date	Expense date (YYYY-MM-DD)
Amount	Expense amount
Category	Food, Transport, Utilities, Entertainment, Other
Description	Short explanation of the expense


⸻

🔄 Application Workflow
	1.	User enters expense details
	2.	Input validation is performed
	3.	Data is stored in CSV file
	4.	Data is analyzed using NumPy & Pandas
	5.	Reports and summaries are generated
	6.	Graphical visualizations are displayed

⸻

▶️ How to Run the Project
	1.	Install required libraries:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

	2.	Run the program:

python expense_tracker.py

	3.	Follow the on-screen menu options
